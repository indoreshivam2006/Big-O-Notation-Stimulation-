# 🚀 Big O Notation Performance Visualizer

An interactive web application that demonstrates the real-world impact of different Big O complexity classes through practical examples.

## 📊 Features

### Algorithm Complexity Comparison
| Big O | Name | Operations | Example | Performance |
|-------|------|------------|---------|-------------|
| O(1) | Constant | 1 | Array access | 🚀 Excellent |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic | 7 | Binary search | ✅ Very Good |
| O(n) | Linear | 100 | Simple search | ⚡ Good |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic | 664 | Merge sort | ⚠️ Acceptable |
| O(n²) | Quadratic | 10.0K | Bubble sort | 🐌 Very Slow |
| O(2ⁿ) | Exponential | 1.0M | Recursive fibonacci | 💀 Very Slow |

### Real-World Impact Examples

#### 📱 Searching 100 contacts on your phone
- **Best**: Hash lookup: Instant! (1 operation)
- **Simple approach**: Linear search: Up to 100 checks
- **Avoid**: Compare all pairs: 10.0K comparisons - Don't do this!

#### 📸 Sorting 100 photos by date
- **Smart approach**: Quick sort: ~664 operations
- **Avoid**: Bubble sort: 10.0K operations - Very slow for large albums!

#### 📚 Finding a book in 100 books
- **Smart approach**: Organized library: ~7 steps using binary search
- **Simple approach**: Random pile: Up to 100 books to check
